      Use calc() to combine ems with svw units. swv stands for small viewport width.
      The 0.5em here operates as a sort of minimum font size, and the 1svw adds a responsive scalar.
      This gives you a base font size that scales from 11.75 px on an iPhone SE up to 20 px in a 1,200-px browser window.

      This specifies a font size of 0.6rem + 0.5svw, but the clamp function ensures the final value is never smaller than 0.9rem and never larger than 1.5rem. 
      This way, very large or very small viewports do not end up with text sizes outside of a reasonable range.
